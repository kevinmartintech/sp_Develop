## Not Using Code Retry Logic
**Check Id:** 54 [Not implemented yet. Click here to add the issue if you want to develop and create a pull request.](https://github.com/kevinmartintech/sp_Develop/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=Use+Code+Retry+Logic)

It is best practice to implement client code to mitigate connection errors, transient errors, and command errors like deadlocks that your client application encounters when communicating with a SQL Server (On-premises SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance and Azure Synapse Analytics).

Retry logic should be implemented by the application/client code "[but if your stored procedure isn't being called by an application, doing it in T-SQL isn't a horrible alternative üóó](https://erikdarling.com/the-art-of-the-sql-server-stored-procedure-error-handling/#:~:text=But%20if%20your%20stored%20procedure%20isn%E2%80%99t%20being%20called%20by%20an%20application%2C%20doing%20it%20in%20T%2DSQL%20isn%E2%80%99t%20a%20horrible%20alternative){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}" - Erik Darling

SQL Server might be in the process of shifting hardware resources  to better load-balance or fail over in a HA/DR (High Availability / Disaster Recover). When this occurs there will be a time normally 60 seconds where your app might have issues with connecting to the database.

Applications that connect to a SQL Server should be built to expect these transient errors. To handle them, implement retry logic in their code instead of surfacing them to users as application errors.

.NET 4.6.1 or later (or .NET Core) can use the [.NET SqlConnection parameters for connection retry üóó](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/troubleshoot-common-connectivity-issues#net-sqlconnection-parameters-for-connection-retry){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (by Microsoft). 

Ensure you are using the failover group name or availability group listener name in your connection string. The SQL Server name should not be something like 'SQL01'. This indicates you are connecting directly to a specific SQL Server instance instead of a group of SQL Servers.

## Not Using Read Committed Snapshot Isolation
**Check Id:** 161 [Not implemented yet. Click here to add the issue if you want to develop and create a pull request.](https://github.com/kevinmartintech/sp_Develop/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=Not+Using+Read+Committed+Snapshot+Isolation)

Enabling Read Committed Snapshot Isolation (RCSI) can effectively resolve numerous blocking and deadlocking issues that may arise.

Frequently, the `NOLOCK (READ UNCOMMITTED)` isolation level is employed to mitigate common instances of blocking and locking. However, it is important to note that this approach introduces its own set of challenges associated with dirty reads.

When RCSI is enabled, data read queries no longer block data writer queries, and likewise, data writers do not block the progress of readers.

Read Committed Snapshot Isolation is the default isolation level for Azure SQL databases.

Special attention should be made to ensure your SQL Server can handle the versioning for data modifications in the tempdb or local Accelerated Database Recovery (ADR) in SQL Server 2019 and greater. A healthy SQL Server configured with best practices first is recommended. Lower environment testing or enable allow snapshot isolation and monitoring the workload, then enable read committed snapshot is recommended.

Remember to remove the `NOLOCK` hints.

You will want to give an account or process only those privileges which are essential to perform its intended function. Start your development with the app user account only a member of the db_reader, db_writer and db_executor roles.

When a vulnerability is found in the code, service or operating system the "Principle of least privilege" lessens the blast radius of damage caused by hackers and malware.

## Not Using Query Execution Defaults
**Check Id:** 56 [Not implemented yet. Click here to add the issue if you want to develop and create a pull request.](https://github.com/kevinmartintech/sp_Develop/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=Not+Using+Query+Execution+Defaults)

There are query execution defaults included in SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) and Visual Studio. These defaults must be maintained or overridden at the connection or session level if needed. If the defaults are not consistently used certain TSQL script, stored procedures or functions might not behave as developed.

When dealing with indexes on computed columns and indexed views, four of these defaults (```ANSI_NULLS```, ```ANSI_PADDING```, ```ANSI_WARNINGS```, and ```QUOTED_IDENTIFIER```) must be set to ``ON``. These defaults are among seven ```SET``` options that must be assigned the required values when you are creating and changing indexes on computed columns and indexed views.

The other three ```SET``` options are ```ARITHABORT (ON)```, ```CONCAT_NULL_YIELDS_NULL (ON)```, and ```NUMERIC_ROUNDABORT (OFF)```. For more information about the required ```SET``` option settings with indexed views and indexes on computed columns, see [Considerations When You Use the SET Statement üóó](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/set-statements-transact-sql#considerations-when-you-use-the-set-statements){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (by Microsoft).

It is not best practice to modify these query execution settings at the SQL Server level.

### SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) and Visual Studio Settings

In SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) and Visual Studio these 5 ANSI execution settings are on by default: QUOTED_IDENTIFIER, ANSI_PADDING, ANSI_WARNINGS, ANSI_NULLS, ANSI_NULL_DFLT_ON

These 2 advanced execution settings are on by default: ARITHABORT, CONCAT_NULL_YIELDS_NULL

### Visual Studio Database Projects

Visual Studio database projects should be setup with the 7 query execution SET defaults (Project Settings > ‚ÄòDatabase Settings‚Äô button). If there have been publish database objects without these query execution defaults, they will need to be updated. It is possible to check the ‚ÄúIgnore quoted identifiers‚Äù and ‚ÄúIgnore ANSI Nulls‚Äù under the ‚ÄòAdvanced‚Äô button when manually publishing the database project.

## Application User is not a Contained User
**Check Id:** 57 [None yet, click here to add the issue](https://github.com/kevinmartintech/sp_Develop/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=The+Application+User+should+be+a+Contained+User)

Users that only access one database should generally be created as contained users which means they don't have a SQL Server "login" and are not found as users in the master database. This makes the database portable by not requiring a link to a SQL Server Login. A database with contained users can be restored to your development SQL Server or a migration event needs to occur in production to a different SQL Server.

## Connection String Not Scalable
**Check Id:** 158 [None yet, click here to add the issue](https://github.com/kevinmartintech/sp_Develop/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=Connection+String+Not+Scalable)

Application connection strings should be set up to be scalable. 3 different connection strings are recommended.

In the beginning, all three connection strings below will have the same content ‚Äì they will all point to your production database server. When you need to scale, though, the production DBA can use different techniques to scale out each of those tiers.

1. **Writes with Real-Time Reads**
   - This connection is hard to scale, so keep the number of queries here to a minimum.  
   - Treat this like a valuable resource.
   - Functions like inserting or modifing database rows, then redirecting or displaying the data directly afterwards would fall into the use case pattern. Determine if it is necessary to redirect to a display UI, or just notify the user of the action. In high usage databases, performing additional database queries could consume resources unnecessarly.
   - Indicate on the connection string `ApplicationIntent=ReadWrite`.
     - See [Specifying Application Intent üóó](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/sqlclient-support-for-high-availability-disaster-recovery#specifying-application-intent){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} by Microsoft
   - Determine the `MultiSubnetFailover` property of `True` or `False`
     - See [Connecting With MultiSubnetFailover üóó](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/sqlclient-support-for-high-availability-disaster-recovery#connecting-with-multisubnetfailover){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} by Microsoft
2. **No Writes with Reads That Can Tolerate Data Older Than 15 Seconds**
   - This connection string has more options to scale out. This is where the majority of queries should go.
   - Think of this as the default connection string.
   - Indicate on the connection string `ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly`.
     - See [Specifying Application Intent üóó](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/sqlclient-support-for-high-availability-disaster-recovery#specifying-application-intent){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} by Microsoft
   - Determine the `MultiSubnetFailover` property of `True` or `False`
     - See [Connecting With MultiSubnetFailover üóó](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/sqlclient-support-for-high-availability-disaster-recovery#connecting-with-multisubnetfailover){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} by Microsoft
3. **No Writes with Reads That Can Tolerate Data Older Than Several Hours**
   - This connection is for operational reporting, and not to be confused with analytical reporting aggregations like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, ... reporting. True analytical reporting should be performed in a system like a data warehouse or Online Analytical Arocessing (OLAP) system.
   - Queries of these types utilize higher amounts of CPU and storage Input/Output.
   - Stakeholders will eventually have to decide whether to prioritize near-real-time data for reports at the expense of slowing down production, or to separate these resource-intensive queries to a data source with a longer delay.
   - Indicate on the connection string `ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly`.
     - See [Specifying Application Intent üóó](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/sqlclient-support-for-high-availability-disaster-recovery#specifying-application-intent){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} by Microsoft
   - Determine the `MultiSubnetFailover` property of `True` or `False`
     - See [Connecting With MultiSubnetFailover üóó](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/sqlclient-support-for-high-availability-disaster-recovery#connecting-with-multisubnetfailover){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} by Microsoft

## Using Service Broker or Database as Queue
**Check Id:** 164 [None yet, click here to add the issue](https://github.com/kevinmartintech/sp_Develop/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=Using Service+Broker+or+Database+as+Queue)

Use a different message queue based system other than SQL Server Service Broker.

Using a database as message queue platform is an anti-pattern. You need to poll which hammers the database. Using a single table for inserts, updates and queries are not performant when all three need to occur on the same table. Clearing the records once the workflow is complete, so do you perform and status update on the row or perform a delete which can be inefficient.

## Slow Network Queries
**Check Id:** 166 [None yet, click here to add the issue](https://github.com/kevinmartintech/sp_Develop/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=Using Service+Broker+or+Database+as+Queue)

There are a couple causes for this type of issue we can see. 

- The first cause is the large result sets, where client apps request numerous rows, leading to unnecessary network utilization and client processing.
    - The recommended resolution is to balance processing between SQL Server and client apps, letting SQL Server handle filtering and aggregations to limit the result at the client app, while more data-related computations should be performed on the client side. Web/app servers cost less than SQL Server's per core license.
- Another cause is when the client app is slow to fetch results and notify SQL Server, resulting in the "ASYNC_NETWORK_IO" wait.
    - The solution is to fetch the results as quickly as possible using a tight loop or storing results in memory for subsequent processing. 
- Another cause might be the client machines under stress, with I/O, memory, or CPU resource constraints, can cause slow processing.
    - The resolution involves diagnosing and eliminating these resource constraints through tools like Performance Monitor.
