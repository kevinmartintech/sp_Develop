# SQL Server Development Assessment Overview
The open source SQL Server Development Assessment project contains the [sp_Develop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevinmartintech/sp_develop/master/sp_Develop.sql) stored procedure. It can be used by database developers, software developers and for performing database code (smell) assessments to adhere to best practices.

**NOTE:** not all checks have been developed. Browse the [Findings](findings) to discover other helpful database development best practices. Use the site search to find best practices super quick!

You can use the link in the [results tab](results-explanations) to navigate to the [Findings](findings) specific check details. Also, feel free to read through the sections as there might not be a check created yet to incorporate other best practices in your development.
